User needs are important to understand and impliment into the final product. I always ask why to their requirements to help me fully understand what they're trying t achieve at
their core. I've found that if I ask why over and over it will lead me to understanding what they're truly trying to achieve. Once I believe I have an understanding of the final 
product I can begin to create user stories. Creating user stories allow me to stay focused on the final product and continue to build off of what I've already completed. 
When I approach developing programs, I prefer an agile approach. I prefer the flexibilty to pivot if requirements change and also keeping my managers or users updated with the 
production of the program. I've tried using the waterfall before but quickly realized the limitations and didn't like building the full product only to miss a few marks. To be a good team member for software development means to not only work from your strengths, but also knowing when it's appropiate to ask for help. Too often do I see that someone will 
not pull their own weight on a portion because they're not comfortable with admitting they need help.
